Noticeable presence of undesired emotions, such as anger or disgust. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is excellent; every word is clearly recognizable. Video recorded with consistently proper recording angle. Speaker occasional glances away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 27% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 35% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 37% without active gesticulation. Video recorded with optimal lighting. Looks like clothes are suitable for the presentation.\"\n",

      "To enhance your presentation skills, focus on managing emotional expressions, especially reducing visible signs of anger or frustration, which can detract from message clarity and audience engagement. Incorporate more natural eye contact with the camera to foster connection and ensure your occasional glances away are deliberate and purposeful. Maintain your natural gesturing but vary it to emphasize key points, enhancing charisma. Given cultural expectations in Russia for clear, confident communication, consider slightly slowing your speech pace during crucial parts and using pauses effectively to reinforce key ideas. Your professional appearance suits the formal context; continue to project confidence through your posture and vocal tone. Overall, refining emotional control and deliberate gestures will make your presentations more convincing and engaging, aligning well with cultural norms for professionalism and clarity.\n"

      "On the video a Black male speaker about 54 years old give a presentation in English. The following characteristics of his video were highlighted by our models: \"rather clean speech with few filler words, such as \"thank you\". Optimal speech rate. Mostly desired emotions presented on the video. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is good; most words are easy to recognize with minimal effort. Video recorded with noticeable deviations from proper recording angle. Speaker occasional glances away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 8% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 8% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 82% without active gesticulation. In average video recorded with too dark lighting. Looks like clothes are suitable for the presentation.\"\n",

Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 17% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 28% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 54% without active gesticulation.

      "To enhance presentation quality, the speaker should work on maintaining better eye contact by consistently facing the camera, which fosters engagement and confidence. Improving recording conditions, such as lighting and camera angle, will make the visuals clearer and more professional. Reducing filler words like “were gonna” and “well” will make speech more concise and impactful. Structuring the speech with clear transitions and pauses will improve intelligibility and flow. Additionally, practicing natural gestures aligned with key points can emphasize messages and keep the audience engaged. Considering cultural expectations, a more formal attire and appropriate posture will enhance credibility.

The following characteristics of her video were highlighted by our models: \"rather clean speech with few filler words, such as \"and the\". Optimal speech rate. Mostly desired emotions presented on the video. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is good; most words are easy to recognize with minimal effort. Video recorded with mostly proper recording angle with minor deviations. Speaker often look away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 11% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 17% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 70% without active gesticulation. Video recorded with optimal lighting. Looks like clothes are suitable for the presentation.\"\n",

      "To enhance your presentation, consider maintaining consistent eye contact with the camera to engage your audience and reduce occasional gaze aversion. Incorporate more deliberate gestures to emphasize key points and foster a dynamic delivery. Vary your pitch slightly to convey enthusiasm and emotion, making your bio-styled content more compelling. Practice pausing after important statements to allow information to resonate. Given cultural communication styles, balancing professionalism with warmth can strengthen connection; a slight smile and natural facial expressions can aid this. Additionally, ensure your background remains distraction-free, which you already do well. Overall, your clear speech and natural gesturing form a strong foundation—building on these with intentional eye contact and expressive variation will make your presentation more engaging and memorable.\n"

Optimal speech rate. Mostly desired emotions presented on the video. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is excellent; every word is clearly recognizable. Video recorded with noticeable deviations from proper recording angle. Speaker often look away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 18% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 23% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 57% without active gesticulation. In average video recorded with too dark lighting. Looks like clothes are suitable for the presentation.\"\n",
