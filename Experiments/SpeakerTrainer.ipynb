Noticeable presence of undesired emotions, such as anger or disgust. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is excellent; every word is clearly recognizable. Video recorded with consistently proper recording angle. Speaker occasional glances away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 27% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 35% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 37% without active gesticulation.

However, emotions like anger or disgust come across and may distract from message impact—working on a more positive or neutral tone will help the audience feel more engaged and receptive. Occasional glances away from the camera break eye contact; maintaining steady gaze will improve connection with viewers.

      "On the video a Black male speaker about 54 years old give a presentation in English. The following characteristics of his video were highlighted by our models: \"rather clean speech with few filler words, such as \"thank you\". Optimal speech rate. Mostly desired emotions presented on the video. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is good; most words are easy to recognize with minimal effort. Video recorded with noticeable deviations from proper recording angle. Speaker occasional glances away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 8% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 8% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 82% without active gesticulation. In average video recorded with too dark lighting. Looks like clothes are suitable for the presentation.\"\n",

To further improve, address the visuals: optimize camera angle to create a more direct, engaging connection with viewers and ensure the lighting is brighter to avoid shadows and help the presenter appear more welcoming. Maintain steady eye contact with the camera to strengthen audience rapport, and if possible, balance out gestures for slightly more expressive delivery throughout—this can subtly boost energy and reinforce key points.

Mostly desired emotions presented on the video. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is moderate; some words are difficult to recognize. Video recorded with significant issues with recording angle throughout the video. Speaker often look away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 17% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 28% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 54% without active gesticulation. In average video recorded with too dark lighting. Looks like clothes are not suitable for the presentation.\"\n",

      "To enhance your presentation quality and delivery, consider adjusting the camera to a proper angle and improving lighting for a more professional look. Maintain eye contact with the camera to engage your audience. Choose attire that aligns with the context—business casual works well for educational presentations. For clearer speech, practice enunciating key terms and reducing casual phrases like “were gonna” or “yeah.” Vary gesticulation more evenly to emphasize key points without overuse or underuse. Finally, slow down slightly and pause between topics for greater intelligibility, and ensure your objectives and structure are clearly signposted throughout the talk.\n"

      "On the video a Asian female speaker about 20 years old give a presentation in English. The following characteristics of her video were highlighted by our models: \"rather clean speech with few filler words, such as \"and the\". Optimal speech rate. Mostly desired emotions presented on the video. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is good; most words are easy to recognize with minimal effort. Video recorded with mostly proper recording angle with minor deviations. Speaker often look away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 11% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 17% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 70% without active gesticulation. Video recorded with optimal lighting. Looks like clothes are suitable for the presentation.\"\n",

      "The presentation is well-structured, clear, and delivered at a comfortable pace, with minimal background noise and strong intelligibility. However, there’s room for improvement. To enhance audience engagement, the speaker could increase eye contact with the camera, as looking away can reduce connection with viewers. While gesturing is generally natural, incorporating a bit more active gesticulation—particularly to emphasize key points—might make the delivery livelier. Slightly varying vocal tone or emotional expression could also add warmth and dynamism to the bio. Lastly, consider segmenting the content with subtle pauses or transitions to highlight achievements and experiences, helping the audience follow the narrative more easily.\n"

The following characteristics of his video were highlighted by our models: \"rather clean speech with few filler words, such as \"for fifa\", \"fifa russia\", \"means a\", \"millions of\", \"for the\". Optimal speech rate. Mostly desired emotions presented on the video. Video doesn't have noticeable background noise. Intelligibility of speech is excellent; every word is clearly recognizable. Video recorded with noticeable deviations from proper recording angle. Speaker often look away from the camera. Gesturing is appropriate and natural. 18% of words were accompanied by active gesticulation, 23% with acceptable and natural gesticulation and 57% without active gesticulation. In average video recorded with too dark lighting. Looks like clothes are suitable for the presentation.\"\n",
